**Built for:** Small to medium-sized businesses, startups, and growing teams

## The Problem We Solve

### The Business Growth Dilemma

You built your business on grit, hustle, and spreadsheets. You're scaling, hiring, expanding.

But now:
- **Invoices are lost** between customer folders and email
- **Inventory snapshots** don't match physical counts
- **Your accountant dreads** month-end close (so do you)
- **Sales reps can't see** customer history across deals
- **Payroll is a nightmare** of manual calculations and error-fixing
- **You have no real business visibility** — no idea where you actually stand

You need **business software that works**.

Most ERPs respond with **6-month implementations, $100k+ licensing, and months of training**. 

We didn't think that was honest.

### Our Answer

Old Dog ERP gives you the tools without the torture:
- **Install and run in minutes** — not weeks
- **Learn by doing** — intuitive UI your team gets right away
- **Extensible via plugins** — add features as you grow
- **Professional-grade data** — SQLite backend, no spreadsheet nonsense
- **Priced for growth** — One-time purchase, lifetime updates
- **Built on values** — Security, transparency, user sovereignty

## Why Old Dog ERP

### 1. It Actually Works

We didn't design this for IT departments. We designed it for business owners and operators.

- **Install in minutes** — not an all-day IT event
- **No vendor lock-in** — your data is yours (SQLite, portable)
- **Learn by doing** — intuitive, built around workflow
- **Works offline** — no cloud dependency, no subscription lock-in

### 2. Priced Fairly

**$299 one-time.** Lifetime updates. No subscriptions. No per-user licensing. No "hidden enterprise fees."

Compare to QuickBooks Online ($30/mo = $360/year), NetSuite (starts at $1,000/mo), SAP (don't ask):

| Feature | Old Dog ERP | QB Online | NetSuite |
|---------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Price** | $299 | $30/mo | $1,000+/mo |
| **Modules** | 7 core | 3 basic | 20+ |
| **Setup Time** | Minutes | Hours | Months |
| **Data Ownership** | 100% yours | Locked in | License |
| **Offline Mode** | ✓ Yes | ✗ No | ✗ No |
| **Plugins/Extensions** | ✓ Yes | Limited | ✓ Yes (expensive) |
| **Your Code** | Run your own | Cloud only | SAP's servers |

### 3. Built for Growth

**Start simple.** As you grow, extend without ripping and replacing.

- Install core modules as needed
- Add plugins when functionality gaps appear
- Use the SDK to build proprietary features
- Never outgrow your software (or pay exponentially more)

### 4. Professional Features, Human-Centered Design

This is enterprise ERP. It does real work:
- Multi-year audit trails
- Real-time financial reporting
- Tax calculation and compliance
- Advanced inventory valuation (FIFO, weighted average)
- Full accounts payable and receivable workflows
- Payroll tax deductions by state

But it's built for a 10-person team, not 10,000. You can master it. Your team will use it.

### 5. Your Data, Your Rules

**Your data lives on your computer.** No cloud vendor. No data harvesting. No "surprise pricing adjustment" three years in. SQLite database, portable, queryable, yours forever.

Want to switch systems? Your data comes with you. Want to analyze it with your own tools? Direct database access. Want offline capability? It's built in.

### 6. Extensible By Design

Not everything fits in a box. That's why we built the Plugin SDK.

- What you need that we don't provide? Build it.
- Industry-specific workflows? Build them.
- Integration with your backend systems? Build it.
- Keep your IP proprietary.
- Sell it on the marketplace if you want.

## Use Cases & Success Stories (Templates)

### Case Study 1: Manufacturing Growth

**Business:** Mid-sized widget manufacturer, 12 employees

**Solution:** 
- Implemented Finance module for cost tracking by product

- Cost: $299 + plugin $29 + team training time (4 hours)

### Case Study 2: Service Business Profitability

**Solution:**
- CRM module for detailed customer tracking

**Result:**

### Case Study 3: Scaling E-Commerce

**Business:** Amazon seller turned web store, $1.4M annual revenue

**Challenge:** Excel-based inventory was out of sync across Amazon FBA, Shopify store, and physical warehouse.

**Solution:**
- Inventory module for central tracking

- Sales module for order tracking across channels
- Finance module for profitability by channel

**Result:**
- Eliminated stockouts (lost $40k+ in Q1 due to overselling)
